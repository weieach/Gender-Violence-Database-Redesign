        "brief": "Various types of in-person and online support are available to women intimate partner violence and abuse (IPVA) survivors. However, we know little about the interplay between them. We investigated the transitions and interactions between these types of help and how their use can be optimized, using a mixed-methods approach (survey N = 107; interviews N = 18). Significant but weak correlations were found for specific IPVA and support types. No significant correlations were found between online and in-person help types. Almost 60% of survey participants expressed interest in blended care. Integration and optimization of online and blended care options can increase outreach and provide an enhanced, tailored help-seeking and recovery journey."

We collected data on psychological, physical, and sexual IPV using an adapted version of the World Health Organization Violence Against Women instrument and division of housework using a validated questionnaire. We used logistic regression to calculate adjusted odds ratios. We found that in mothers who reported an unequal gender division of housework (higher load), the odds of suffering psychological, physical, or sexual IPV were higher during the first and second years of the pandemic."

        "brief": "It remains unclear if mandatory reporting (MR) of sexual violence (SV) in universities impacts student reports of SV. MR may deter students from disclosing SV under certain circumstances (e.g., alcohol, perpetrator). This study evaluated students’ likelihood of reporting SV under MR policy across perpetrators, violence, and alcohol use. Female students received instructional manipulations describing either confidential or mandatory reporting policies before reading four vignettes describing SV. They rated their likelihood of reporting each vignette. Significant differences arose across vignettes, conditions, and alcohol consumption. This indicates MR can significantly decrease reporting likelihood in some cases, while alcohol consumption may increase the likelihood."

Currently, there are few standardized measurement tools to gauge Chinese stakeholders’ perceptions and beliefs concerning DV. This research sought to validate tools to be used with such stakeholders. Factor analyses were utilized on cross-sectional, survey data from a purposive sample of 683 Chinese DV professionals working in four institutions in Guangdong. Analyses developed three scales for measuring DV Definitions, DV Attitudes, and DV Policing. The development of these scales is beneficial to advance the already growing research related to DV in China in ways that are relevant to the Chinese context."

The current study drew upon interviews with health professionals (n = 27) and victim-survivors (n = 20) to provide a realist account of how this intervention achieved its goals. Findings show that five change mechanisms explain why Health Pathfinder was effective as an ecological intervention: awareness, expertise, relationships, empowerment, and evidence. Positive progress in respect of each mechanism had meaningful impacts on victim-survivor experiences of enquiry, disclosure, and uptake of services and had the potential to meaningfully impact health inequities."

Qualitatively, perspectives from 131 women (113 comments; 18 interviews) who attended some form of group treatment were analyzed. Of the 199 coded comments about the IPV groups, most were positive (157 or 78.9%), while the remaining 21.1% (42) reflected concerns or suggested changes. Clinical implications are provided."

In this study, we analyze this route as a continuum of violence and also study the interstices to confront it. Using a biographical narrative methodology, we analyze the narratives of 52 migrant women, through life stories or creative narrative workshops carried out in Mali, Morocco, and Spain. The results allow us to systematize the continuum of violence that the women report, understood as a pedagogy of cruelty but also the possible spaces to build a safe landscape."

Data collected among Italian adults (N = 407; 59.5% women) showed that individual levels of precarious manhood beliefs—according to which manhood is a social status that must be proven via public action—were related to greater sexual harassment myths acceptance in male and female respondents. Such associations were mediated by hostile sexism and benevolence toward men. Findings suggest that interventions to reduce tolerance of sexual harassment of women should target cultural views of manhood and counteract rigid models of masculinity and femininity."

However, prior research has found that survivors of domestic and sexual abuse may also value other factors outside of the legal system. This study explores perceptions of justice held by 96 survivors of domestic abuse. Responses to an online survey indicate that perceptions of justice are complex and multifaceted. Survivors often spoke of justice as accountability, restoration, postabuse support, and validation. The findings highlight the many justice considerations, and solely emphasizing criminal legal system outcomes may be misguided. Implications for additional research and practice are provided."

        "brief": "Objective This article examines how gendered lived experiences—the constellation of women's quotidian, on-the-ground encounters and perceptions of gender inequality—shape highly educated women's sex preference attitudes in contemporary urban China. Background Recent theoretical developments highlight women's experiences and views of gender (in)equity as powerful forces that drive their fertility aspirations and behavior. Yet, extant research on sex preference has overwhelmingly focused on features of the patrilineal family institution and overlooked the role of gendered lived experiences. Method This study adopts a mixed-methods approach, combining six waves of the nationally representative China General Social Survey (2010–2018) and 70 in-depth interviews. Results Quantitative analysis found that compared to those with exclusive daughter preference, highly educated urban Chinese women who exclusively desired sons held similarly egalitarian views on gender. Qualitative analysis further demonstrated that invoking lived experiences of gender injustice, these women framed their son preference attitudes as “a mother's duty” of wanting to shield their children from gendered hardship. They viewed raising daughters amidst pervasive gender discriminations as emotionally taxing hard work. Meanwhile, such preference aligned with entrenched familial expectations that demanded male offspring, thereby holding behavioral implications for second-birth outcomes. Conclusion This study uncovers previously obscured reasonings—beyond the outright devaluation of girls—that undergird highly educated urban Chinese women's son preference attitudes. Implications By unpacking how gendered lived experiences underpin the nuanced reasonings behind some highly educated urban Chinese women's son preference attitudes and the behavioral implications, this article joins the theoretical conversation that considers how gender egalitarians may perpetuate gender unequal outcomes."
