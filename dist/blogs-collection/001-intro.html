                        <p>
                            The <abbr title="Gender Violence Database">GVD</abbr> is designed to be a search tool for
                            researchers, practitioners, and the general public looking for relevant research about
                            gender-based violence. Work on the Database began in 2012 as an effort to solve a problem:
                            the gap between the universities producing research on one hand and the growing number of
                            non-profit organizations charged with putting this research into practice on the other—an
                            ever-widening gap between evidence production and evidence-based practice in the field.
                            While non-profit and social service organizations have always relied upon research generated
                            in universities, a shift in emphasis from experiential and grassroots knowledge to
                            professionalization and evidence-based practice over the last two decades has meant that
                            many organizations have had to seek out new sources of information and guidelines for their
                            work.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Unfortunately, many of these same non-profit organizations do not have the resources,
                            personnel, or university connections to secure and take full advantage of such access. If
                            NGOs are expected to use evidence-based practices in providing a safety net for vulnerable
                            populations, they need predictable access to the best available evidence with as few
                            barriers as possible.

                        <p>
                            The <abbr title="Gender Violence Database">GVD</abbr> team sought to bridge the
                            research-practice gap by rendering the choices that practitioners make in selecting evidence
                            much more precise and useful within the current publishing environment. Central to this goal
                            was the development of a database that
                            (1) offered a consistent set of tags (or keywords) and categories useful for searches across
                            the many disciplines comprising the field of gender violence and
                            (2) facilitated intersectional search strategies that would enable practitioners and
                            researchers to refine their searches to most precisely reflect their current evidentiary
                            needs.
                            In devising every aspect of the project, the <abbr
                                title="Gender Violence Database">GVD</abbr> team imagined its primary user as a
                            practitioner with time-sensitive, intersectional needs operating under economic and time
                            constraints.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The <abbr title="Gender Violence Database">GVD</abbr> team first had to determine which
                            topics to include under the “gender violence” umbrella. We ultimately decided to take a
                            comprehensive approach to the field, seeking to include sources that contributed not only to
                            knowledge about discrete acts of violence but to an emerging understanding of the contexts,
                            structures, and precursors of gender violence. The team’s inclusive definition appears in
                            the “About” section of the <abbr title="Gender Violence Database">GVD</abbr> site:
                        </p>

                        <blockquote>
                            <p>
                                Our scope includes forms of harm committed on the basis of gender, that are gendered in
                                action, or that reinforce forms of gender oppression already in place. We include
                                research focused on forms of harm such as intimate partner violence, sexual violence,
                                stalking, and trafficking as they affect adults or children in any place in the world.
                                We also include research that addresses the consequences of gender-based violence and
                                that proposes intervention and/or prevention strategies.

                        <p>
                            Following the socio-ecological model first introduced by Urie Bronfenbrenner and familiar
                            from public health approaches, the <abbr title="Gender Violence Database">GVD</abbr> team
                            organized the working schema to account for research operating at each of its five levels:
                            intrapersonal factors (knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, and identity characteristics),
                            interpersonal factors (friendships, social networks, family supports, etc.), institutional
                            and organizational factors, community factors, and policy factors (including local, state,
                            federal, and international policies). Using the socio-ecological model to organize tags
                            meant that sources that addressed issues of structural violence and collective oppression
                            could be included in the database alongside more readily familiar forms of gender-based
                            violence.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The next step in building the database was the construction of a working schema—a set of
                            search terms (or key words) applicable to both past and ongoing research in the field. In
                            developing and testing the schema, the team first collected and provisionally tagged
                            scholarly journals explicitly focused on gender-based violence (e.g., <cite>Violence Against
                                Women</cite>) as well as journals that focused either on gender or violence as primary
                            topics. (Yes, our process has always included reading, and sometimes skimming, all
                            potentially relevant sources one at a time.) Beginning with this set of approximately
                            fifteen journals from across a wide range of disciplines—social work, psychology,
                            criminology, feminist theory, sociology, and medicine chief among them—the team devised a
                            common set of terms and categories that would intelligibly apply across these areas.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The team quickly recognized that a crucial challenge in identifying and synthesizing
                            research across disciplines for both practitioners and researchers is the sheer variety of
                            discipline-specific terms that compete to describe nearly identical contexts, phenomena, or
                            populations. For example, criminology journals most often refer to individuals who have
                            suffered from gender-based violence as “victims,” while other journals in social work and
                            feminist theory refer to this same category of individuals as “survivors.” Within
                            disciplines, too, terms have changed over time in ways that the <abbr
                                title="Gender Violence Database">GVD</abbr> team aimed to render consistent for users;
                            for example, the term “intimate partner violence” currently describes the phenomenon known
                            in early scholarship as “wife-beating” and that later came to be called “domestic violence.”
                            The <abbr title="Gender Violence Database">GVD</abbr> team grappled with choices in
                            determining the terms that best represented the current understanding and best practices in
                            the field, at times choosing terms that specific researchers and disciplines did not choose
                            for themselves. Developing this initial schema, a consensus-driven process that lasted a
                            full academic year, meant that the team was engaging in a deliberate and strategic
                            re-mapping of the field of gender violence in the name of multidisciplinary practitioner and
                            researcher access.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In these initial steps, too, the students learned a great deal about the assumptions and
                            conventions of scholarly publishing, including the routine practices of journal editors and
                            contributors that (sometimes inadvertently) contribute to inconsistent terminology and
                            categorization across the field. They learned, for example, that journal contributors
                            themselves are responsible for providing keywords and search terms for their research
                            articles. When there are no standards of consistency for keywords built into the journal’s
                            publishing process, it is quite often the case that these contributors apply terms
                            describing similar populations or phenomena differently even within the same journal issue,
                            so researchers are likely to miss important sources without the steps the team took to
                            ensure cross-disciplinary consistency. The students saw firsthand the utility of their
                            day-to-day work applying the schema tags.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Although we use our working schema as a behind-the-scenes tool, the schema’s organizing
                            principles also structure the primary search apparatus for database users. On the search
                            page, users can either perform a traditional keyword search (which searches titles and
                            abstracts) or choose from an expandable list of hierarchically ordered tags grouped into
                            four general categories: Population (which offers choices of demographic and
                            identity-related factors), Issues (which includes a list of forms of gender-based violence,
                            from the intrapersonal to the political level), Responses (interventions in the published
                            research), and Source Type. Sub-categories nest within larger categories so that users can
                            refine their searches. A second column displays a list of sources that most closely match
                            the current search parameters (beginning with the most recently published matches); from
                            here, users can click on the titles of their search results, view the abstract and
                            publication information, narrow their search for open access articles, and/or generate a
                            tailored annotated bibliography.

                                It is worth noting that the full list of tags offers users a sense of the multiplicity
                                and complexity of categories available for searches, inviting users to explore research
                                beyond their initial searches and thus quietly teaching them about the scope and depth
                                of gender violence as a field.

                            It is crucial to highlight that feminist principles have guided the day-to-day work of
                            decision making and workflow since the project’s beginning and help make this project a

                        </p>

                        <p>
                            First, in devising and curating the schema terms, the <abbr
                                title="Gender Violence Database">GVD</abbr> team prioritized intersectional principles
                            at every stage of decision-making. Intersectionality—the understanding that individuals
                            possess interlocking identities (of race, class, gender, sexual orientation, ability status,
                            etc.) that render individuals differently vulnerable to structures of oppression—shapes both
                            the lived experiences of people impacted by violence and the interventions and practices
                            designed to prevent violence and support survivors. An intersectional approach depends upon
                            understanding how an individual’s identities may work in concert to create barriers or
                            opportunities for effective intervention; so, for example, a survivor of sexual violence who
                            is an undocumented immigrant and a legal minor will likely require different forms of
                            intervention than a white lesbian citizen survivor of sexual assault on, say, a college
                            campus. Searches work best if the search terms themselves are flexible and responsive to
                            such interlocking identities and contexts. Rather than using tags that would combine
                            multiple identities—“lesbian survivors of child abuse”—as many publications do, the <abbr
                                title="Gender Violence Database">GVD</abbr> team assigns tags that break down identity
                            markers into the smallest possible categories so that users can run searches that recombine
                            each of those categories in nuanced and productive ways.

                            Intersectional approaches are crucial in a field where both research and practice have
                            historically prioritized normative populations to the detriment of groups and individuals
                            who are most vulnerable to multiple forms of violence as a consequence of their current and
                            historical oppression and marginalization. With its most visible contemporary origins in
                            second-wave feminist activism in the 1970s and 80s, Gender Violence as a scholarly field has
                            only relatively recently begun to move beyond a disproportionate focus on white, cisgender
                            heterosexual female survivors to investigate the compounding vulnerabilities most survivors
                            face. Providing tags that allow for nuanced, intersectional searches remains a priority for
                            the team; in practice contexts, the need for new information, innovative interventions, or
                            deeper understanding about underrepresented populations are likely scenarios that prompt
                            time-sensitive literature searches. It is essential, then, for any tool to provide
                            accessible ways to move beyond normative searches to include a wide range of identities and
                            contexts.

                        <p>
                            bell hooks’ margin-to-center approach further informed the <abbr
                                title="Gender Violence Database">GVD</abbr> team’s intersectional principles of schema
                            development. This approach begins scholarly and activist investigation with a focus on
                            historically marginalized populations—on individuals and groups that possess the most
                            interlocking oppressed identities; the margin, rather than the center, then, becomes the
                            starting point for theoretical and practical interventions aimed at dismantling seemingly
                            intractable systemic problems like gender-based violence. Implicit in this approach is the
                            assumption that interventions that are truly effective for marginalized populations will
                            almost inevitably also be effective (or easier to adapt) for those in the center, who face
                            far fewer challenges. By contrast, the converse approach—beginning with the normative center
                            and working outward toward the margins (which entails ad hoc incorporation of contextual
                            complexity and identity-based vulnerabilities) has historically been ineffective and
                            exclusionary. Addressing the much more complicated experiences of those on the margins
                            demands a nuanced attention to contexts and structures that create layers of heightened
                            vulnerability to violence on one hand—and serious barriers to access to services and support
                            on the other.

                        <p>
                            In addition to its intersectional feminist approach to research curation, the <abbr
                                title="Gender Violence Database">GVD</abbr> student team also consistently engages in
                            feminist practice and pedagogical engagement. Weekly meetings are highly collaborative and
                            emphasize the expertise of students in the weeds of the research: these meetings begin with
                            reports on innovations in the field, and subsequent conversations regularly focus on topics
                            that include the conventions of journal publishing, the tensions among disciplines that
                            differently define problems, populations, and interventions, the role of users and usability
                            studies in site design, and the challenges of ethically applying labels to people,
                            phenomena, and scholarship genres. Following feminist principles, almost every decision
                            about the database—the process for including new tags to the schema, the design of the logo
                            and interface, the inclusion or exclusion of sources, the protocols for usability studies,
                            etc.—happens by consensus. In addition, students also write blog posts about their
                            particular contributions to the project for publication on the <abbr
                                title="Gender Violence Database">GVD</abbr> website; many of these posts highlight
                            students’ reflections on the state of the research as well as on the ethical and feminist
                            challenges they have encountered in database construction.

                        <p>
                            One example of feminist engagement among the student team is the group-generated process for
                            introducing new tags to the existing schema. Even though we took great care in the project’s
                            initial stages to create a schema that reflected the state of this multidisciplinary field,
                            it was inevitable that new topics and areas of study continue to emerge in the
                            scholarship—fields of study evolve, after all—and we had to develop a process for
                            incorporating them.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Because <abbr title="Gender Violence Database">GVD</abbr> team members read through each
                            article before adding it to the database, they observe firsthand new trends surfacing in the
                            scholarship. Additionally, team members typically engage with articles in chronological
                            order, which primes them to notice when new topics emerge and which topics stay relevant to
                            the scholarship. When themes not yet included in the schema emerge in multiple articles
                            across issues of a journal and/or in a variety of journals, team members propose the need
                            for a new tag to the whole <abbr title="Gender Violence Database">GVD</abbr> team in one of
                            the regular weekly group discussions.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Given the volume of articles already in the database—right now, approaching 15,000 sources
                            and growing—adding a tag is a serious matter; a new tag in the schema means going back
                            through all previous sources already in the database to make sure we didn’t miss any other
                            earlier candidates for that tag.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Above all, we keep the experience of the user in mind when proposing or creating a new tag,
                            always asking: will the new tag allow users a more intuitive and efficient search of
                            specific topics? If the team agrees that the new tag will be useful, the tag enters its
                            trial or experimental phase. (You’ll see a few places on the schema that have yellow
                            highlighting; these are the experimental tags currently under consideration.) During the
                            experimental phase, our discussions focus primarily on tag clarity and definitional
                            independence. In order to ensure clarity of the new definition, we test it against articles
                            previously flagged as good candidates for the tag. If the new tag overlaps too much with the
                            definition of other tags or does not include all scholarship related to the topic, we edit
                            the new tag’s definition and test it again. The new tag will likely go through a few
                            revisions because we aim to create a tag that fits the scholarship instead of describing
                            only a fraction of scholarship that fits the tag.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            This process is one of many that our team grapples with on a regular basis in the service of
                            creating a truly useful tool for practitioners and researchers. I am very happy to talk more
                            about processes and structural issues in the Q&amp;A.
