                    <section aria-labelledby="gvd-overview">
                        <p>While working on the Gender Violence Database throughout 2023, I focused on the ways in which
                        religion and religious identity can shape experiences of gender-based violence as well as paths
                        of healing for survivors. During my previous work with the Gender Violence Database, I noticed
                        an emerging awareness of the specific religious contexts that can shape experiences of gender
                        violence; in the social work journals I had previously focused on, this translated to a need for
                        culturally-sensitive approaches in therapy and other social work fields. However, there seemed
                        to be a general lack of scholarship within gender violence-focused journals addressing religious
                        contexts of gender-based violence both in terms of culturally-specific approaches and concerning
                        broader implications about religious institutions serving as forces of harm as well as as spaces
                        for healing for survivors.</p>

                        I discovered the Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion in my search for scholarship discussing
                        gender violence and religion together. I worked through each issue from the start of the journal
                        in 1985, tagging articles discussing dynamics of gender-based violence in religious contexts.
                        The most common type of article addressing gender violence in this journal was short-form pieces
                        or reflections written by scholars addressing a specific topic or theme, such as teaching
                        dynamics of gender violence and religion in the university classroom. The next most common
                        category was scholarship analyzing gender violence within religious texts, often taking into
                        consideration the difficulties in applying today’s gender violence terminology to historical
                        contexts in which that terminology did not yet exist. Many scholars published in the Journal of
                        Feminist Studies in Religion also applied a theoretical framework or discourse analysis to
                        examine a particular dynamic of gender violence within religious contexts. A few articles
                        brought in research discussing the experiences of survivors of gender-based violence but rarely
                        followed a qualitative approach with methods such as interviews and/or surveys, instead drawing
                        from other sources such as past observations and research or their own experiences.</p>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        Within analyses of gender violence in religious texts came challenges with the very practice of
                        assigning tags –– which is also essentially assigning terms, especially difficult to do when
                        reading about historical contexts in which the words I used to tag articles didn’t yet exist or
                        were otherwise not understood or applicable in the discourses of the time. Part of the tagging
                        process requires drawing our own conclusions about what tags most accurately reflect the content of an article –– for example, I might recognize an article as discussing topics related to the "structural" tag, even if the author doesn't explicitly use the term "structural" in their article. However, where this becomes particularly tricky is in analyses of historical texts. Because the term "intimate partner violence," for example, did not exist when a particular religious text was written, is it possible to tag an article analyzing that text with that term? Figuring out what terms to use is something the authors of these articles struggle with themselves, such as one author defining what they are discussing as "intimate partner violence" in the abstract but examining their use of that term deeper in the actual text of the article. As another example, how would choosing either the tag “rape” (defined in the tagging guide as “non-consensual sex perpetrated by someone the victim/survivor does not know”) or the tag “acquaintance” (defined in our guide as “non-consenual sexual acts between people who know each other”) ever fully and adequately reflect the dynamics of sexual violence in a journal article about sexual slavery in the Bible? In that case, discerning “stranger” rape versus “acquaintance” rape felt not only impossible, but inane and reductive to the actual dynamics at play. And yet, wrestling with each tag to ensure that it is categorized correctly to be the most helpful for those using the database is part of the process, as difficult and impossible that process can feel.
                        </p>

                        <p>

                        Amidst these difficulties, some tags often applied well to various articles discussing religion
                        and gender-based violence. Common tags used for articles within the Journal of Feminist Studies
                        in Religion included “creed,” defined in our schema as “structural violence in religious or
                        ritualized beliefs, practices, and organizations,” and “faith,” defined in our schema as
                        “initiatives implemented by religious organizations and/or according to faith-based goals and/or
                        values.” These tags went beyond simply defining which religious context an article referenced,
                        representing larger themes and structural issues that emerged within these analyses of religion
                        and gender-based violence.</p>

                        <p>What remains largely under-researched in the Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion, as well as
                        other current scholarship on gender violence in general, is the voices of survivors themselves
                        discussing the dynamics that emerge within their specific religious contexts, whether that be to
                        analyze structures silencing and shaming survivors or to highlight culturally important contexts
                        that may arise for survivors in their healing processes, among other vital and under-researched
                        topics. I do not mean to single out this particular journal –– these voices are needed in
                        scholarship across disciplines. My experiences in the past few years tagging articles within various journals focusing on gender-based violence reveal that bringing in dynamics of religion within this scholarship remains rare. A journal focusing on gender violence that does not include voices of survivors in religious contexts or largely ignores any analysis of gender violence in religious institutions misses specific contexts of power and control that can potentially shape survivors’ experiences in significant and all-encompassing ways. To further research dynamics of gender-based violence such as spiritual abuse as well as to better understand how religious identity may shape how survivors conceptualize their experiences and approach healing and resilience, scholarship on gender violence must consider the role religion plays in survivors’ experiences.</p>
